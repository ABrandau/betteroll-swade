![Chat Window](img/chat_modifiers.png)

You can use this to quickly add modifiers to a roll.

You can either set a one time modifier or a persistent modifier. If you click once, the selected icon will turn white and will be deselected after one roll. Click twice, it will turn red and will apply to any roll until you deselect it.

Use the "Trait roll modifier" line to affect any trait roll either from a skill, attribute or item.

Use "Number of trait dice" to use multiple trait dice on a skill roll, either from a skill, attribute or item card.

Finally the "Damage roll modifier" adds modifiers to damage rolls.

If you prefer to hide this section, you can find an option to collapse it by default in the settings.
