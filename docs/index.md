You can use this to quickly add modifiers to a roll. Note that it adds all teh selected modifiers, that way you can click on 2 and 1 or 4 and -1 to get add 3 to a roll.

You can either set a one time modifier or a persistent modifier. If you click once, the selected icon will turn white and will be deselected after one roll. Click twice, it will turn red and will apply to any roll until you deselect it.

Use the "Trait roll modifier" line to affect any trait roll either from a skill, attribute or item.

Use "Number of trait dice" to use multiple trait dice on a skill roll, either from a skill, attribute or item card.

The Master's mod line will turn red with one click and will stay on red until you click it again. It will add the modifier to all the rolls (trait or damage) of every actor, either player or dn controlled. Note that this selection survives reloads and the closing of the world.

Finally, the "Damage roll modifier" adds the selected number to damage rolls.

If you prefer this section to start hidden, you can find an option to collapse it by default in the settings.
