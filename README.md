# Better rolls for SWADE

This is an alpha for version 2 of the module. If you are not familiarized with it you are probably better using the 1.x version.

Please leave your feedback on the official discord, feel free to ping me if you want. 

Criticism, feature request, UI changes are all welcome, but if you want me to do something about it, please be as detailed as you can with it. Please at least tell me what you expect and why do you believe your approach is better.
